    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Construct various NLP based models demonstrating multiple approaches to classifying the sentiment of 9000 tweets regarding their sentiment towards either Apple products, Android products or both. I will be using the SpaCy word vectorization library and then I will use those vectorizations (along with simple Bags of Words techniques) to classify the sentiment of each tweet. After determining the best binary classification model, I will then attempt to create a tertiary classification model that introduces 'neutral' tweets as well.\n",

    "### Goal 2 - Identify Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To discern the best model for each task I will begin with a basic baseline with a Gaussian Naive Bayes model dependent on context free 'bag of words'. Part of the model process will be to try to accurately identify the products discussed in the individual tweets. I will then iterate in two ways: 1) in pre-processing methods. I will have one dataset that is simply a context-free bag of words, another that will be normalized, context-dependent tokenization using SpaCy's tokenization pipeline and third I will use methods similar to the second dataset, but will also remove all stop words and include SpaCy's entity tag training methods. 2) I will examine different modeling pipelines, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, TF-IDF and Sequential Neural Networks.\n",
